# Task Requirements

1. Create/Delete Notes [done]
2. Reactive Interface [done]
3. Responsive UI (for mobile -> keep screen size less than 450px and refresh browser) [done]
4. Deep search within notes (title & note text) [done]
5. Auto-updating timestamp [done]
6. Use of Local Storage for back end work [done]
7. Hosted on Github Pages -> https://yaseen-nadaf.github.io/notes/

# Important 

1. Preferred to go with different flow for mobile and large devices hence didn't implement collapse/expand of sidebar since requirement was to keep sidebar opened in large devices and collapsed in mobile.

2. I have never used or worked on Redux, hence will learn it soon in near future and didn't use it in this task.
